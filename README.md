👋 Hey there! I'm N B V SUBBA RAIDU, a passionate Data Engineer based in the United States, with a knack for crafting robust data pipelines that drive impactful insights. With over 3 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in designing and implementing data solutions using a diverse tech stack, including SQL, Python, PySpark, SnapLogic Pipelines, and Databricks.

🛠️ My technical toolkit encompasses a wide array of skills, from data warehousing concepts and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure to web development frameworks like React Native and Angular. I'm proficient in version control using Git and Bitbucket and well-versed in both Waterfall and Agile methodologies.

💼 In my most recent role at EnScope IT LLC, I honed my skills in creating efficient data pipelines, collaborating seamlessly with cross-functional teams, and ensuring data integrity through meticulous monitoring and documentation. Prior to that, at Data ERP Systems, I led a team in developing ETL pipelines that significantly streamlined workflows, saving valuable time and resources.

📚 Outside the professional realm, I've undertaken various academic projects, from analyzing Formula 1 race data using Azure Databricks to developing ETL pipelines for financial market data on AWS S3. I'm also passionate about leveraging technology for social impact, as demonstrated by projects like "Not For Sale," an iOS and Android app aimed at connecting donors with those in need.

🎓 I hold a Master of Science in Information Systems from the University of Memphis and a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Sathyabama University.

🌟 I'm always excited to collaborate on innovative data projects and contribute to the vibrant developer community on GitHub.

Let's build something awesome together! 🚀
